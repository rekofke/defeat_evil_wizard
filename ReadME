Defeat the Evil Wizard
Python terminal based rpg battle simulator.

Description
This is a project for the Advanced Python module at Coding Temple. It is a text based battle simulation where the goal is to select one of 4 pre-created characters. 
Each character has different special abilities, an attack function, a heal function and the ability to view-stats. The goal is to alternate turns in an attempt to defeat the "Evil Wizard"
